# Android-App-Settings-Structure
This is a demo about Android4.4 App Settings' structure. I improve it to add general ViewPager in order to beautify and customize its interface.

### Interface:

<img src="https://github.com/cwgoover/Android-App-Settings-Structure/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true" width="450" />

### Function:

* Show _system applications_, _third party applications_ and _disabled applications_, three types of applications on Android phone.
* Can disable/enable application in the list. (need system permission)
* Search any of applications by its label or package name.
* Disable/Enable all the GMS applications with one click in the Settings.

`**Note that**`: If you want to normal running it, this app needs **SYSTEM PERMISSION**.
